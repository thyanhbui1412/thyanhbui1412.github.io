### ETL - Data Pipelines

[How fast are NYC firefighters?](/FireDispatch)

I automated workflow to extract data from NYC Fire dispatch, clean and visualize with ELK Stack.
Turned out crazy traffic in Manhattan doesn't stop it from being the 2nd quickest borough to response to fire alarm!

*This project streams data directly into OpenSearch cluster provisioned via AWS and analyzez NYC fire alarms between 2012 and 2021. This project is applied with the knowledge of principles of containerization, terminal navigation, python scripting, artifact deployment and AWS EC2 provisioning.*

[Quiet and safe neighborhood in NYC: possible or not?](/Noise-Crime)

This is a team project when I took the class Data Warehouse at Baruch College, which sparked a lot of curiosity from me and I therefore embarked on data engineer career path. In this project,

I learn to build a mini ETL where I streamlined NYC open data with Socrata API to target data warehouse GCP, then streamed from GCP to Jupiter Notebook for data profiling, then used dbt built data marts, fact tables in GCP.

I developed [Python script](/Noise-Crime/DWProject-ExtractingNoiseData.py) to stream real-time data. I also took main part in performing ETL logic, workflows and data transformation with dbt, which was documented [here](https://github.com/thyanhbui1412/Noise-Crime/blob/src/ETL%20project%20-%20311%20NYC%20Open%20Data%20Source.pdf). Working in a team, I learned to maintain well-documented codes and process. If time permitted, I want to build Python scripts to backfill archive data and upcoming data, schedule a production run in dbt so that the ETL process is continously streamed and transformed.
